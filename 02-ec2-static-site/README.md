## **Brief Explanation**

I launched a Free Tier Ubuntu EC2 instance in the public subnet to host a static resume website. Nginx was installed and configured through the terminal, and the default index page was replaced with my resume HTML file. The instance security group allows HTTP traffic from anywhere and SSH access only from my IP address for security. Hardening steps included OS updates, disabling password SSH logins, and exposing only required ports. The website is accessible publicly over port 80.
