# **Billing & Free Tier Cost Monitoring**

## **a) Why cost monitoring is important for beginners**

Beginners often leave resources such as EC2 instances, load balancers, NAT Gateways, or EBS volumes running unintentionally, causing unexpected charges. Billing alarms help prevent surprises by notifying users when spend exceeds a defined threshold.

## **b) What causes sudden increases in AWS bills**

Common causes include NAT Gateway hourly charges, large data transfer, unused EC2 instances, uncleaned EBS volumes, ALBs running continuously, or enabling non–Free Tier services. Free Tier usage alerts help detect when limits are being exceeded.
