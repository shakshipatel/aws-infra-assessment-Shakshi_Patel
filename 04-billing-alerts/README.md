## 📘 Why This Matters (Beginner-Friendly Explanation)

AWS billing can increase unexpectedly when resources are left running—especially NAT Gateways, EC2, ALB, RDS, S3 storage, or data transfer.  
Beginners often forget to shut down workloads after testing.  
A CloudWatch Billing Alarm helps detect unwanted spend by sending alerts when monthly charges exceed a threshold (₹100 here).  
Free Tier Usage Alerts notify when you are about to exceed AWS Free Tier limits.

This setup improves cost visibility and prevents unnecessary charges.
